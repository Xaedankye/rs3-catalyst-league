## Usage Questions

### How do I search for my RuneScape character?
Click the search box in the top-right corner and enter your exact RuneScape username. The app will fetch your data from the RuneScape API.

### Why can't I find my character?
- **Check spelling**: Make sure the username is exactly correct
- **Try different formats**: Some usernames have special characters or spaces
- **API availability**: The RuneScape API might be temporarily down
- **Account status**: Make sure your account is active and public

### How often does the data update?
- **Task Tracker**: Updates when you search for a player
- **Clan Progress**: Updates automatically every 10 minutes in the background
- **Smart caching**: Uses 1-hour cache for league progress, 30-minute cache for clan members
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents API overload with intelligent request spacing

### Can I track multiple characters?
Currently, you can only view one character at a time. You can switch between characters by searching for different usernames.

### How does the League Clan Progress feature work?
The League Clan Progress feature shows your entire clan's progress in the Catalyst League:
- **Automatic clan detection**: When you search for your player, it automatically loads your clan
- **Live updates**: See each clan member's progress as it loads
- **Background refresh**: Data updates automatically every 10 minutes
- **Smart caching**: Uses intelligent caching to reduce API calls

### What if the RuneScape API is down?
If the API is unavailable, you can still use the app in manual tracking mode. You'll need to manually mark tasks as complete, but the app will remember your progress.
