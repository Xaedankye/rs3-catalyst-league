## Usage Questions

### How do I search for my RuneScape character?
Click the search box in the top-right corner and enter your exact RuneScape username. The app will fetch your data from the RuneScape API.

### Why can't I find my character?
- **Check spelling**: Make sure the username is exactly correct
- **Try different formats**: Some usernames have special characters or spaces
- **API availability**: The RuneScape API might be temporarily down
- **Account status**: Make sure your account is active and public

### How often does the data update?
Data updates automatically when you search for a player. The app doesn't continuously poll the API to avoid overloading RuneScape's servers.

### Can I track multiple characters?
Currently, you can only view one character at a time. You can switch between characters by searching for different usernames.

### What if the RuneScape API is down?
If the API is unavailable, you can still use the app in manual tracking mode. You'll need to manually mark tasks as complete, but the app will remember your progress.
